Top down zombie demo
A demo of me learning to use animations on the main character, and animation blueprints with locomotion to get the player to display a different animation depending on what the character is doing, Also using behavior trees and ai perception to make the zombies chase after the player. Implementing GAS(gameplay ability system) to add damage to te zombies and also to add the ability to shoot and reload.
